# Schmod Blender Bindings
A Blender Hotkey addon for making Blender use more ergonomic and in line with other 3D DCCs and Game Engines. The focus on this addon is minimizing hand movement, especially from the mouse, speeding up commands, and ensure that modifier keys are consistently useful through selection contexts. Also includes a quick hotkey switcher on the Tools Side bar for swapping between Blender default hotkeys and schmod hotkeys. This is part of the Schmodular Pipeline Tools but can be downloaded and imported as an addon in Blender as standalone.
